# ProtT5 Training and Evaluation Workflow

This repository contains a complete workflow for training, evaluating, and fine-tuning a ProtT5 model for protein sequence classification using PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers.

## **Set Up Instructions**
To run this locally, use conda and the use the environment.yml file to ensure dependencies are installed.

Use *run.py*, and modify with your dataset inputs. This file starts training, validation, prediction and outputs metric accuracies for all. You fine-tuned model will be saved, and re-used in prediction.
